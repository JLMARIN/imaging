## Important Notes About This 'backup' Branch ##

This 'backup' branch contains all the development and testing of multiple software SKD, APIs, command line tools and software tools in general that were used with the cameras. Different results were obtained with multiple software options before selecting the option that showed the best performance. This branch started as the 'master' branch and after the final selection, the branch 'backup' was created for future reference purposes. The 'master' branch was later cleaned up.

Care must be taken when operating in this branch, although it is not advised. Use for reference purposes only.

The structure of the repository is as follows.

***codes***

* Contains all the codes.

***configuration tests***

* Contains picures taken with different configuration, for comparison.

***lenses tests***

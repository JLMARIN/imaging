# MATLAB Scripts #

This repository contains MATLAB scripts used for image processing. There are two main functions implemented by these scripts:

1) 1-dimnensional image alignment based on correlation. This is a simplified image alignment algorithm that works on a single dimension. It was used with the spec3 system. Currently this functions are deprecated and not being maintained. This code is kept here for reference purposes only. For the active image alignment software go to the alignment folder in the main directory.

2) Vegetation Index calculation. These scripts calculate vegetation indices and create false colored images with a given color scale.

## Dependencies ##

These scripts were created using MATLAB 2016a. They should run on this on any later MATLAB distribution. In theory, it should be possible to run these scripts in [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org) too, but it has not been tested.
